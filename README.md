# Cell-Phone-Towers
_The objective of this project is to design and implement a command-line program capable of allocating frequencies to a list of Cell Phone Towers based on their geographical proximity. The program aims to minimize interference by ensuring that neighboring cells do not share the same frequency._

## Project Goal
_The primary goal is to achieve an efficient frequency allocation plan where cells that are farthest from each other share the same frequency._

## Setup Instructions

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Albert-Willemse/Cell-Phone-Towers.git
    ```

3. Run the setup script (for Windows users):

    ```bash
    .\setup.bat
    ```

5. Run the script:

    ```bash
    Cell Phone Towers.py
    ```
